### Integrating the API with the frontend

- Altered the next.config.ts file to include rewrites and headers.
    ```ts
    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
        rewrites: async () => {
            return [
                {
                    source: "/api/:path*",
                    destination: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? "http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/:path*" : "/api/"
                }
            ]
        },
        async headers() {
            return [
                {
                    // matching all API routes
                    // https://vercel.com/guides/how-to-enable-cors
                    source: "/api/:path*",
                    headers: [
                        { key: "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", value: "true" },
                        { key: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", value: "*" },
                        {
                            key: "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
                            value: "GET,OPTIONS,PATCH,DELETE,POST,PUT",
                        },
                        {
                            key: "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
                            value:
                                "X-CSRF-Token, X-Requested-With, Accept, Accept-Version, Content-Length, Content-MD5, Content-Type, Date, X-Api-Version",
                        },
                    ],
                },

    }
    ```

## Implement Authorization 
> `2025-02-08` | [@clxrityy](https://github.com/clxrityy)

- [Authorization Code with PKCE Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-pkce-flow)
    - Added the following endpoints to the API:
        - `/api/auth`
        - `/api/callback`
- Changed the `redirect_uri` from `http://localhost:5000/api/callback` to `http://localhost:3000`.
- Set up a code challenge and code verifier for the authorization code flow.
- You can now access user data after authorization.

## Accessed user data on the frontend

> `2025-02-08` | [@clxrityy](https://github.com/clxrityy)

- I added these server actions:
    - `setTokens()`: Sets the access and refresh tokens in the cookies.
    - `getToken()`: Gets the access token from the cookies.
    - `deleteToken()`: Deletes the access token from the cookies.

### Authorization flow

1. User navigates to the main route (`/`) ([`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)).
2. The `page.tsx` component checks if the user is authenticated by calling the `getToken()` function.
    - If the user has a valid access token, they are considered authenticated.
3. By default (before authentication), the user can click the *"Login with Spotify"* button which redirects them to the `/api/auth` endpoint.
    - This endpoint generates the authorization URL and redirects the user to Spotify's authorization page.
    - The user is prompted to log in to their Spotify account and authorize the application.
4. After authorization, Spotify sends the user back to the redirect URI (`http://localhost:3000`) with an authorization code in the URL.
    - The `/api/callback` endpoint handles the callback from Spotify.
    - It exchanges the authorization code for an access token and refresh token.
    - The tokens are then stored in cookies using the `setTokens()` function.
5. The user is redirected back to the main route (`/`) where they are now authenticated.

### Accessing user data

- Once the user is authenticated, the `page.tsx` component fetches the user's data from the [`https://api.spotify.com/v1/me`](https://api.spotify.com/v1/me) endpoint using the access token.
    - If the response is successful, the user's data is stored in state and displayed on the page.

### Resources / References

- [Functions: cookies | Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies)
    - **Note**: The cookie documentation suggests you can use `cookies()` from `next/headers` within a server component, but this is not the case. You must use `cookies()` within a server action and then call it from a **client** component with `useEffect()` to access the cookies on the client side.

## Top 10 Artists & Tracks

> `2025-02-10` | [@clxrityy](https://github.com/clxrityy)

When clicking the user button (top right corner) (must be logged in), you can see your top 10 artists and tracks.
- The data is fetched from the backend API endpoint (`/api/auth/profile/top/<type>`) where `<type>` can be either `artists` or `tracks`.
    - The endpoint fetches the user's top 10 artists or tracks from Spotify.
- The data is displayed in a modal on the frontend.

## Search for artists and tracks

> `2025-02-12` | [@clxrityy](https://github.com/clxrityyy)

You can now search for artists and tracks using the search bar(s) on the homepage.
- The search bar queries the backend API endpoint (`/api/search/<type>/<query>`) where `<type>` can be either `artist` or `track`.
    - The endpoint fetches the search results from Spotify. (`https://api.spotify.com/v1/search`)

### Client-side display

- The search results are displayed as the query is typed.
    - If the user clicks out of the area of focus, the search results are no longer visible.
- (For now) only **1** artist or track is displayed at a time.

Many hooks and components were created to handle the search functionality.

- Installed `lodash` for debouncing the search queries.

```tsx
"use client";
// ...
import {
    useCallback,
    // ...
} from "react";
import debouce from "lodash/debounce";

const debouncedSearch = useCallback(debouce(async (searchQuery: string) => {
    // ...
}, 300), [
    // ...
])
```

> See [`Search.tsx`](/src/components/ui/Search.tsx) for more details.
